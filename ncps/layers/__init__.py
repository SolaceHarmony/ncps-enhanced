"""NCPS layer system.

This module provides Keras-compatible implementations of continuous-time neural cells:

Core Cells:
- BaseCell: Foundation for continuous-time cells
- CfCCell: Closed-form Continuous-time cell
- LTCCell: Linear Time-invariant Continuous-time cell

Advanced Cells:
- CTGRUCell: Continuous-time Gated Recurrent Unit
- CTRNNCell: Continuous-time RNN
- ELTCCell: Enhanced Linear Time-invariant Continuous-time cell
