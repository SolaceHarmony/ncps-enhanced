Advanced Features
=================

Time-Aware Processing
---------------------

Time-aware processing allows for variable time steps in neural
computations:

.. code:: python

# Variable time steps
time_delta = mx.random.uniform(
    low=0.5,
    high=1.5,
shape=(batch_size, seq_len)
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))

# Process with time information
outputs, states = model(x, time_delta=time_delta)

State Management
----------------

Explicit state management provides fine-grained control over neural
network state:

.. code:: python

# Initialize states
batch_size = 32
initial_state = mx.zeros((batch_size, model.cell.units))

# Process with explicit state
outputs, final_state = model(x, initial_states=[initial_state])

Backbone Networks
-----------------

Backbone networks provide additional feature extraction capabilities:

.. code:: python

# Create model with backbone layers
model = CfC(
    cell=CfCCell(
        wiring=wiring,
        backbone_units=[64, 32],  # Two backbone layers
        backbone_layers=2,
        backbone_dropout=0.1
    ),
return_sequences=True
)))))))))))))))))))))

Integration with Abstractions
-----------------------------

These advanced features integrate with our abstraction layers:

1. Time-Aware Processing

- Uses TensorAbstraction for tensor operations
- Leverages GPUAbstraction for efficient computation
- Integrates with LayerAbstraction for consistent behavior

2. State Management

- Managed through LayerAbstraction
- Optimized via TensorAbstraction
- Hardware-accelerated through GPUAbstraction

3. Backbone Networks

- Implemented through LayerAbstraction
- Uses optimal tensor operations
- Automatically uses best available hardware

This document provides insights into key system features that are
implemented through our abstraction system.
