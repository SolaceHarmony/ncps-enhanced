# Core Design Documentation

This directory contains the core design specifications and component-level design documents that form the foundation of our architecture.

## Purpose

1. Core Design
   - Define fundamental system architecture
   - Specify class hierarchies
   - Document core operations
   - Define layer configurations
   - Specify wiring systems

2. Component Design
   - Detailed component specifications
   - Interface definitions
   - Component interactions
   - Extension points

## Usage

These design documents should be consulted when:
1. Implementing core system features
2. Adding new components
3. Modifying existing components
4. Understanding system architecture

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **Abstractions**: Core designs inform the abstraction layer implementations
- **Implementation**: Provides the specifications that implementation plans execute
- **Knowledge Base**: Informed by architectural insights and framework knowledge

## Design Principles

1. Clear Separation of Concerns
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Clean interfaces between components
   - Clear dependency management

2. Extensibility
   - Well-defined extension points
   - Pluggable components
   - Flexible configuration

3. Maintainability
   - Clear documentation
   - Consistent patterns
   - Testable designs

## Version Control

Design documents should be updated when:
1. Making significant architectural changes
2. Adding new core features
3. Modifying component interfaces
4. Changing system behavior

## Next Steps

1. Component Designs
   - Add detailed component specifications
   - Document interface contracts
   - Specify extension mechanisms

2. Integration Specifications
   - Document component interactions
   - Define communication patterns
   - Specify integration points

This directory serves as the authoritative source for system design specifications, providing the foundation for implementation work.
