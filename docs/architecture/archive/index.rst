Archived Architecture Documentation
===================================

This directory contains archived documentation from previous
architectural approaches. These documents have been superseded by the
new abstraction-based architecture but contain valuable insights that
informed the new design.

Archived Documents
------------------

Backend System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``backend_system_design.md``: Original backend system design
- ``backend_implementation_plan.md``: Implementation plan for backend

system

- **Key Insights Used**: Backend detection and selection patterns

Activation System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``activation_system_refactor.md``: Original activation system refactor
- **Key Insights Used**: Activation function abstraction patterns

Layer System
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``layer_system_refactor.md``: Original layer system refactor
- **Key Insights Used**: Layer implementation patterns

Relationship to New Architecture
--------------------------------

These archived documents informed several aspects of the new
abstraction-based architecture:

1. From Backend System:

- Backend detection mechanisms
- Priority-based selection
- Fallback patterns

2. From Activation System:

- Clean separation of interfaces
- Framework-specific implementations
- Type safety patterns

3. From Layer System:

- Layer implementation patterns
- Framework adaptation
- State management

New Architecture Documents
--------------------------

The new architecture is documented in:

1. Abstraction Designs:

- ``abstractions/tensor_abstraction.md``
- ``abstractions/layer_abstraction.md``
- ``abstractions/gpu_abstraction.md``
- ``abstractions/liquid_integration.md``

2. Implementation Plans:

- ``implementation/phase1_abstractions.md``
- ``implementation/phase2_liquid.md``
- ``implementation/index.md``

Migration Notes
---------------

When migrating from old to new architecture: 1. Replace backend
selection with TensorAbstraction 2. Replace activation system with
LayerAbstraction 3. Use GPUAbstraction for hardware acceleration 4.
Follow liquid integration guide for neural networks

This archive serves as a reference for understanding the evolution of
the architecture and the rationale behind the current design decisions.
