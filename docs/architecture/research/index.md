# Architecture Research

This directory contains research documents, exploration findings, and experimental designs that inform our architectural decisions but may not be part of the current implementation.

## Purpose

The research directory serves as a space for:
1. Architectural experiments
2. Performance investigations
3. Technology evaluations
4. Future directions

## Contents

### Current Research Areas

1. Performance Research
   - Hardware acceleration patterns
   - Memory optimization strategies
   - Computation efficiency

2. Framework Research
   - Framework comparison studies
   - Integration patterns
   - Performance characteristics

3. Architecture Patterns
