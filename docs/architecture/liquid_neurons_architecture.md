# Liquid Neurons Architecture Overview

## Core Philosophy
Following MLX's example, we're creating a focused implementation for liquid neurons that:
- Mirrors Keras's interface while maintaining our own infrastructure
- Supports only liquid neurons and related components
- Prioritizes simplicity and maintainability

## Key Components

### 1. Base Infrastructure

#### BaseCell
- Foundation for all liquid neurons

## Technical Details

### 1. State Management
```python

        return [ops.zeros((batch_size, self.units))]
        
    def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
        x, t = self._process_inputs(inputs)
        return self._update_state(x, states[0], t)
```

### 2. Time Processing
```python
class TimeAwareMixin:
    def process_time_delta(self, time_delta, batch_size):
        if time_delta is None:
            return 1.0
        return ops.reshape(time_delta, [-1, 1])
```

### 3. Feature Extraction
```python
class BackboneMixin:
    def build_backbone(self, input_size, units):
        return [
            layers.Dense(units, activation=self.activation)
            for _ in range(self.backbone_layers)
        ]
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cell
```python
cell = CfCCell(
    wiring=wiring,
    mode="pure"
)
output, state = cell(input, prev_state)
```
