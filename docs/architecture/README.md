# NCPS Architecture Documentation

## Current Documentation Initiative

We are in the process of migrating our architecture documentation to Sphinx. This will provide better integration with our existing documentation system, improved features, and a better experience for both users and developers.

## Key Documents

### Sphinx Migration

2. [Integration Plan](sphinx_integration_plan.md) - Detailed plan for Sphinx integration
3. [Conversion Example](sphinx_conversion_example.md) - Example of markdown to RST conversion
4. [Migration Timeline](sphinx_migration_timeline.md) - Week-by-week implementation plan

### Architecture Documentation
1. [Abstractions](abstractions/) - Core abstraction layer designs
2. [Implementation](implementation/) - Implementation plans and timelines
3. [Knowledge](knowledge/) - Architectural insights and knowledge base
4. [Design](design/) - Core design documentation
5. [Research](research/) - Research and exploration documents

### Archive
Old documentation versions and formats are preserved in the [archive](archive/) directory for reference.

## Next Steps
1. Review the Sphinx migration overview
2. Follow the integration plan
3. Use the conversion example as a guide
4. Track progress against the timeline

## Contributing
