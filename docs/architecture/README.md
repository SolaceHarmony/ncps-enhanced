# NCPS Architecture Documentation

## Current Documentation Initiative

We are in the process of migrating our architecture documentation to Sphinx. This will provide better integration with our existing documentation system, improved features, and a better experience for both users and developers.

## Key Documents

### Sphinx Migration
1. {doc}`Migration Overview <sphinx_migration_overview>` - High-level overview of the Sphinx migration initiative
2. {doc}`Integration Plan <sphinx_integration_plan>` - Detailed plan for Sphinx integration
3. {doc}`Conversion Example <sphinx_conversion_example>` - Example of markdown to RST conversion
4. {doc}`Migration Timeline <sphinx_migration_timeline>` - Week-by-week implementation plan

### Architecture Documentation
1. {doc}`Abstractions </architecture/abstractions/index>` - Core abstraction layer designs
2. {doc}`Implementation </architecture/implementation/index>` - Implementation plans and timelines
3. {doc}`Knowledge </architecture/knowledge/index>` - Architectural insights and knowledge base
4. {doc}`Design </architecture/design/index>` - Core design documentation
5. {doc}`Research </architecture/research/index>` - Research and exploration documents

### Archive
Old documentation versions and formats are preserved in the {doc}`archive </architecture/archive/index>` directory for reference.

## Next Steps
1. Review the Sphinx migration overview
2. Follow the integration plan
3. Use the conversion example as a guide
4. Track progress against the timeline

## Contributing
During this transition period, please:
1. Add new documentation in RST format
2. Follow the examples in {doc}`sphinx_conversion_example`
3. Use the Sphinx features outlined in the integration plan
4. Test documentation builds locally before committing

This README will be updated as we progress through the migration process.
