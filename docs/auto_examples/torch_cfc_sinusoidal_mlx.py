"""
MLX Implementation of Continuous-time Feedback Control (CFC) for Sinusoidal Task

This example demonstrates how to use the CFC model with MLX backend to learn
sinusoidal patterns. It showcases:
- Basic CFC model setup
- Training on time-series data
- Performance visualization
- MLX-specific optimizations
