"""
PyTorch Implementation of Neural Circuit Policies for Atari Games

This example demonstrates how to use NCPs with PyTorch for training agents on Atari games.
It showcases:
- Setting up an NCP model for Atari environments
- Training with standard RL algorithms
- Performance visualization and monitoring
