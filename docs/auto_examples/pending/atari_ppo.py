PPO Implementation of Neural Circuit Policies for Atari Games

This example demonstrates how to use NCPs with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
for training agents on Atari games. It showcases:
- Setting up an NCP model for Atari environments
- Implementing PPO training algorithm
- Performance monitoring and visualization
